# JavascriptSecurePasswordGenerator

This is a javacript secure password generator that allows users to copy the password to their clip board and varies length from 8 to 20 characters.
It uses CSS and HTML for a pretty clean UI in my opinion.

This idea and most of how to make it was learned from Coding Artist on youtube.
